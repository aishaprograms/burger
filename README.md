# burger
This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars. It follows the MVC design pattern; it uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Technologies used
- Node.js
- Express
- MySQL
- JawsDB

## Getting Started
Visit the Heroku app:

* **Eat Da Burgerz** - [Eat Da Burgerz](https://stormy-dawn-25901.herokuapp.com/)

## Understand
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
